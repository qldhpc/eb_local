If moses does not install go to /pkg/suse12/software/torch/7-foss-2017a and type:
./bin/luarocks install moses
But it should download automatically during installation.

The archive has to be downloaded by hand since to get the install script you need to execute git on the local 
filesystem. Downloading the archive off github does not work. Obviously it will have to be updated if a new 
release of Torch happens.
